	  The old cfi flash driver is mainly an adopted version from U-Boot v1
	  whereas the new driver contains some more experimental features such
	  as selecting the supported chiptypes and bus widths making the driver
	  smaller.
	  Normally you should stick with the new driver, but if you experience
	  troubles you could try the old driver. Please report if the new driver
	  breaks something.
